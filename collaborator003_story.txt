My name is Sergio R. and this is my diary. My day started waking up at 8 a.m. During the morning I revised some concepts in order to prepare for my new job position starting next month. I had lunch at 1:30 p.m.
I started the Master's lectures at 2 p.m. When they finished I did some homework until I had dinner at 10 p.m.
Later, I watched a TV series until I went to sleep at 12 p.m.
