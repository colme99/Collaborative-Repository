* 'git clone' + HTTPS link : it was used to clone the repository. Because of this, adding the username and PAT was also required.
* 'git config user.name' + username : this was required to be able to commit changes to the different repository branches.
* 'git checkout iria_perez_varela' : used to ensure that the changes commited will be performed on the correct collaborator branch. The branch is not created in this command because it was already created using the webpage.
